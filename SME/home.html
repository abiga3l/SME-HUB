            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are vital to Kenya's economy, driving employment, innovation, and economic growth. Defined by having fewer than 250 employees and annual revenues ranging from KSh 1 million to KSh 100 million, SMEs in Kenya span various sectors, including agriculture, retail, manufacturing, and services. These businesses are characterized by flexibility, innovation, and strong ties to local communities. They contribute significantly to GDP and employment, providing jobs for a large portion of the Kenyan workforce. However, SMEs face challenges such as limited access to finance, high operational costs, and complex regulations. Despite these obstacles, they have considerable growth potential, particularly through digital transformation, local product demand, and expanding agricultural value chains. SMEs remain central to poverty reduction and fostering sustainable economic development in Kenya.</p>

            <p>Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a vital role in the economy, providing employment opportunities and driving economic growth. However, they face a range of challenges that can hinder their growth and success. One of the main challenges is access to finance, as SMEs often struggle to secure the necessary funding to invest in their businesses and expand their operations. Additionally, they may lack the resources and expertise to effectively manage the complexities of modern business, such as digital marketing and e-commerce. Other challenges include intense competition, changing consumer preferences, and the need to adapt to new regulations and market conditions.

All these challenges require SMEs to be agile, innovative, and proactive in order to remain competitive and sustainable in today's fast-paced business environment.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Some of the challenges small and medeium sized businesses face are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Access to financing:</strong> SMEs often struggle to access the financing they need to grow and expand their businesses. This can be due to a lack of collateral, limited credit history, or difficulty in securing loans from traditional lenders</li>
                <li><strong>Competition:</strong> SMEs often face intense competition from larger, more established businesses. This can make it difficult for them to differentiate themselves and attract customers.</li>
                <li><strong>Regulatory compliance:</strong> SMEs must comply with a variety of regulations and laws, which can be time-consuming and costly. Failure to comply with these regulations can result in fines and legal action.</li>
                <li><strong>Talent Acquisition and retention:</strong> SMEs often struggle to attract and retain skilled employees. This can be due to limited resources, lack of brand recognition, or difficulty in competing with larger companies for talent.</li>
                <li><strong>Marketing and branding:</strong> SMEs often have limited resources for marketing and branding, which can make it difficult for them to compete with larger businesses. This can result in limited customer awareness and lower sales.</li>
                <li><strong>Technological change:</strong> SMEs must keep up with rapid technological change in order to remain competitive. This can be challenging, as it requires significant investment in new technologies and training for employees.</li>
